GHG Offset: Vehicle Equivalency Calculator
This is a simple web-based calculator that helps estimate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) savings from using Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) compared to fossil fuels, and translates those savings into equivalent numbers of passenger vehicles or heavy-duty diesel trucks removed from the road for one year.

The calculator features a modern, responsive design built with Tailwind CSS.

Features
Energy Input: Enter the energy in Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu).

Selectable Baseline Fuel: Choose from pre-defined Carbon Intensity (CI) values for Fossil Gasoline, Fossil Diesel, and Fossil Natural Gas, based on California Air Resources Board (CARB) data.

RNG CI Input: Enter the Carbon Intensity of the Renewable Natural Gas (RNG).

GHG Savings Calculation: Calculates total GHG savings in pounds of CO₂e.

Vehicle Equivalency: Converts GHG savings into the equivalent number of passenger vehicles and heavy-duty diesel trucks.

Modern UI: Clean and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

How to Use
Enter Energy (MMBtu): Input the total energy in MMBtu that you are analyzing.

Select Baseline Fuel: Choose the fossil fuel (Gasoline, Diesel, or Natural Gas) that your RNG is replacing from the dropdown menu. The corresponding Carbon Intensity (CI) value will be used in the calculation.

Enter CI of RNG (gCO₂e/MJ): Provide the Carbon Intensity of your Renewable Natural Gas. This value can often be negative, indicating a net reduction in emissions.

Click "Calculate GHG Savings": The results will be displayed below, showing the total GHG savings and the equivalent number of vehicles.
